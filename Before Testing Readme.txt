Before using this:

Step 1:	Firstly before running this keylogger you need to Create a Folder in your C drive and name that as "logs"[the name of the file must be exactly same as shown otherwise you will get error]

Step 2:	Inside that logs file you will have to create a text file with name "logs"[[the name of the file must be exactly same as shown otherwise you will get error].

Step 3: Now you have to give the accessable permission to the file. For that you will have to go to the logs.txt file and Right click on that and go to propoerty from their go to security tab,and then go click on "Edit" of "Group or user names", and then go to "Add", and the select "Advanced" option,then click on "Find Now",and then on name column double click on the username which you are using currently.
[In Short: double click on logs.txt > properties > Security > Edit > Add > Advanced > Find Now > find the username which you are using now > double click on that > Ok > Ok > Ok > Apply > Ok].
