This keylogger is not visible any where in the Window machine. 
Even it doesn't show any icons in taskbar nor it is visible. 

After making executable file if anyone started the keylogger and wants to stop the keylogger then we have to go to the Taskmanage and then from their we have to end task. 
By this keylogger will stop.
